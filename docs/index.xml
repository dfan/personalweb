      <description>If you’ve ever attended a hackathon, you know how fun working on projects and learning in a fast-paced environment can be. There’s tons of technical workshops, speakers, mentors, great people, free food, energy drinks, hardware, and fun events. Maybe a bit of sleep too :)
A lot of work goes behind organizing a large hackathon like HackPrinceton, but not all of the work is “techy”. We grapple with many interesting logistical, communication, and management challenges, and I hope to give a glimpse of what some of those entail.</description>

      <description>TigerTexts | Spring 2018 Finding coursebook info for Princeton students is unnecessarily difficult. I built a web app that consolidates Princeton coursebook pricing from multiple sources, and offers third-party seller options, thus providing the most complete information on cheap textbooks. Built in Express.js, React, Redux, Python, and MongoDB.
    Lyff | PennApps Fall 2017 We built a voice bot that users can call to order a Lyft ride.</description>
