My personal [web site](http://www.davidfan.io), generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a modern static site generator written in Go.
Deployment is through ``/docs`` folder in ``master`` branch.

Installation and Development:
1. Install hugo: ``brew install hugo``
2. Run local development server: ``hugo server``
3. Build static site into ``/docs`` folder before pushing new changes
