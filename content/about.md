### Short Bio
Hi there! I am a computer science student at Princeton University, graduating in spring 2019. I am generally passionate about using technology and quantitative methods to solve interdisciplinary problems. More specifically, I enjoy solving problems using machine learning and software. My background is in research and software engineering. My past experiences include software engineering at Amazon Web Services and Phosphorus, as well as bioinformatics research at Harvard Medical School. I have published in venues such as Nature Physics. My interests include machine learning, computer vision, big data, optimization, information storage and retrieval, distributed systems, and healthcare.

I also have leadership experience; on campus, I am director emeritus of HackPrinceton (Princeton's biannual 1,100 person hackathon) and the Princeton University Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament. Broadly, my mission is to create value in the world. Through everything I do, I hope to utilize my skills and talents to make the world a better place.
