### Industry
[**Amazon Web Services**](https://aws.amazon.com) | Software Engineering Intern | East Palo Alto, CA  
*June - August 2018*

- Worked on [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), a distributed cloud-native relational database, and AWS' fastest growing service.
- Developed production cluster service to automate ticket resolution using Java, DynamoDB, and internal service APIs. Improved on-call engineer productivity.
- Wrote tool for enabling/disabling autoscaling policies and provisioning IOPS on pre-prod clusters.

[**Phosphorus**](https://phosphorus.com) | Software Engineering Intern | New York, NY  
May - August 2017

- One of 30 Princeton Start-up Immersion Program participants placed at early-stage or series A startups.
- Redesigned management portal and implemented custom UI/UX components in admin dashboard using Wicket and Scala.
- Created distributor preference scoping model in Scala, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. Wrote AWS Cloud Formation
templates.

### Academic/Research
[**Princeton Vision and Learning Lab**](http://pvl.cs.princeton.edu/) | Undergrad Researcher | Princeton, NJ  
*September 2018 - current*

- Doing a senior thesis in computer vision and deep learning, related to single-view 3D reconstruction: the problem of recovering 3D structure from a single 2D image.

[**Harvard-MIT HST**](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) | Bioinformatics Research Intern | Boston, MA  
*June - August 2016*

1. Claims-wide Association Study (CWAS)
    - Worked with [Prof. Isaac Kohane](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/zak-kohane) and [Dr. Arjun Manrai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uzzY6UAAAAAJ&hl=en) to develope a new association study called "claims-wide association study (CWAS)" - like genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but for insurance claims.
    - Built a data visualization tool for plotting heatmaps of the USA from parsed AETNA insurance claims, at multiple levels of geographic specificity (zipcode, county, state, regional)
    - Used R, MySQL, and the Shiny web framework; code [here](https://github.com/dfan/CWAS_Census).

2. [User-friendly Bioinformatics Tools (UBiT2)](http://ubit2.com/)
    - Worked with [Dr. Jean Fan](https://jef.works/) to develop an open-source web application for client-side RNA-seq and qPCR data analysis.
    - All computation and data visualization is done client-side, thus providing a secure and fast environment for bioinformatics that involves no server.
    - Built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Code [here](http://ubit2.com/).
    - Submitted manuscript to [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/118992).

[**Rutgers New Jersey Medical School**](http://njms.rutgers.edu/) | HS Research Intern | Newark, NJ  
*June - August 2014*

- Investigated effects of the Rasâ€¢GTP-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in Drosophila fruit flies on organismal and organ senescence.
- Conducted lifespan and stress (starvation, oxidative and heat) assays on flies with transgenes expressing varied levels of Rpd3 protein in the heart tissue.
- Conducted heartbeat measurements on flies throughout various stages in their lifespan to analyze heart-function decline with age.
- Co-authorship in a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600623/) published in Aging, and semifinalist status in the 2015 Intel Science Talent Search (STS).

[**Rutgers Dept. of Physics**](https://physics.rutgers.edu/) | HS Research Intern | Piscataway, NJ  
*June - August 2013*

- Explored symmetry-breaking phase transitions in multiferroic materials (i.e. rare-earth hexagonal manganites).
- Polished and imaged these materials.
- Analyzed topological defect distribution using published theoretical results.
- Co-authorship in a paper published in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3142).
