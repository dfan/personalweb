[**Amazon Web Services (AI)**](https://aws.amazon.com) | *Seattle, WA*  
**Software Engineer**, August 2019 - July 2020

- [Elastic Inference](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/elastic-inference/) reduces inference costs by enabling users to flexibly provision GPU compute.
- Added logging metrics and launched canaries to support new EC2 G4 instance family.
- Launched Elastic Inference-enabled PyTorch framework for SageMaker, EC2, and ECS (see my AWS [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/reduce-ml-inference-costs-on-amazon-sagemaker-for-pytorch-models-using-amazon-elastic-inference/)). Implemented TorchScript graph validation, shipped updated AWS Deep Learning Conda environments and Docker containers, benchmarked performance for vision and NLP models on multiple platforms, and wrote technical blog post.
- Created proof-of-concept for building and integrating TensorRT-enabled TensorFlow 2.1 into the inference engine. Reduced latency by up to 70% compared to FP32 native TensorFlow in benchmarks.

[**Amazon Web Services (Databases)**](https://aws.amazon.com) | *East Palo Alto, CA*  
**Software Engineering Intern**, June - August 2018

- Developed automated devops tool for [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), a distributed cloud-native relational database, which improved on-call engineer productivity by automatically applying fixes to low-severity tickets and reducing manual processes.
- Wrote a tool for enabling/disabling autoscaling policies and provisioning IOPS on DynamoDB clusters to improve cost management.

[**Harvard-MIT HST**](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) | *Boston, MA*  
**Bioinformatics Research Intern**, June - August 2016

1. Claims-wide Association Study (CWAS)
    - Worked with [Prof. Isaac Kohane](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/zak-kohane) and [Dr. Arjun Manrai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uzzY6UAAAAAJ&hl=en) to develope a new association study called "claims-wide association study (CWAS)" - like genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but for insurance claims.
    - Built a data visualization tool for plotting heatmaps of the USA from parsed AETNA insurance claims, at multiple levels of geographic specificity (zipcode, county, state, regional)
    - Used R, MySQL, and the Shiny web framework; code [here](https://github.com/dfan/CWAS_Census).

2. [User-friendly Bioinformatics Tools (UBiT2)](http://ubit2.com/)
    - Worked with [Dr. Jean Fan](https://jef.works/) to develop an open-source web application for client-side RNA-seq and qPCR data analysis.
    - All computation and data visualization is done client-side, thus providing a secure and fast environment for bioinformatics that involves no server.
    - Built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Code [here](http://ubit2.com/).
    - Technical report posted on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/118992).
