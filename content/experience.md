### Industry
[**Amazon**](https://amazon.com) | *Seattle, WA*  
**Applied Scientist**, May 2021 - present  
**Research Engineer**, July 2020 - May 2021

- Doing computer vision research with a current focus on video understanding for [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers).
- Paper accepted to CVPR 2021 about a novel pretext task for self-supervised representation learning on long-form videos (i.e. movies).

[**Amazon Web Services (AI)**](https://aws.amazon.com) | *Seattle, WA*  
**Software Engineer**, August 2019 - July 2020

- [Elastic Inference](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/elastic-inference/) reduces inference costs by enabling users to flexibly provision GPU compute.
- Added logging metrics and launched canaries to support new EC2 G4 instance family.
- Launched Elastic Inference-enabled PyTorch framework for SageMaker, EC2, and ECS (see my AWS [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/reduce-ml-inference-costs-on-amazon-sagemaker-for-pytorch-models-using-amazon-elastic-inference/)). Implemented TorchScript graph validation, shipped updated AWS Deep Learning Conda environments and Docker containers, benchmarked performance for vision and NLP models on multiple platforms, and wrote technical blog post.
- Created proof-of-concept for building and integrating TensorRT-enabled TensorFlow 2.1 into the inference engine. Reduced latency by up to 70% compared to FP32 native TensorFlow in benchmarks.

[**Amazon Web Services (Databases)**](https://aws.amazon.com) | *East Palo Alto, CA*  
**Software Engineering Intern**, June - August 2018

- Worked on [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), a distributed cloud-native relational database, and AWS' fastest growing service.
- Developed production cluster service to automate ticket resolution using Java, DynamoDB, and internal service APIs. Improved on-call engineer productivity.
- Wrote tool for enabling/disabling autoscaling policies and provisioning IOPS on pre-prod clusters.

[**Phosphorus**](https://phosphorus.com) | *New York, NY*  
**Software Engineering Intern**, May - August 2017

- One of 30 Princeton Start-up Immersion Program participants placed at early-stage or series A startups.
- Redesigned management portal and implemented custom UI/UX components in admin dashboard using Wicket and Scala.
- Created distributor preference scoping model in Scala, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. Wrote AWS Cloud Formation
templates.

### Academic/Research
[**Princeton Vision and Learning Lab**](http://pvl.cs.princeton.edu/) | *Princeton, NJ*  
**Undergrad Researcher**, September 2018 - current

- Did an undergraduate senior thesis in computer vision and deep learning, related to single-view 3D vision.
- Paper accepted to CVPR 2020 conference.

[**Harvard-MIT HST**](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) | *Boston, MA*  
**Bioinformatics Research Intern**, June - August 2016

1. Claims-wide Association Study (CWAS)
    - Worked with [Prof. Isaac Kohane](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/zak-kohane) and [Dr. Arjun Manrai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uzzY6UAAAAAJ&hl=en) to develope a new association study called "claims-wide association study (CWAS)" - like genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but for insurance claims.
    - Built a data visualization tool for plotting heatmaps of the USA from parsed AETNA insurance claims, at multiple levels of geographic specificity (zipcode, county, state, regional)
    - Used R, MySQL, and the Shiny web framework; code [here](https://github.com/dfan/CWAS_Census).

2. [User-friendly Bioinformatics Tools (UBiT2)](http://ubit2.com/)
    - Worked with [Dr. Jean Fan](https://jef.works/) to develop an open-source web application for client-side RNA-seq and qPCR data analysis.
    - All computation and data visualization is done client-side, thus providing a secure and fast environment for bioinformatics that involves no server.
    - Built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Code [here](http://ubit2.com/).
    - Submitted manuscript to [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/118992).

[**Rutgers New Jersey Medical School**](http://njms.rutgers.edu/) | *Newark, NJ*  
**HS Research Intern**, June - August 2014

- Investigated effects of the Rasâ€¢GTP-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in Drosophila fruit flies on organismal and organ senescence.
- Conducted lifespan and stress (starvation, oxidative and heat) assays on flies with transgenes expressing varied levels of Rpd3 protein in the heart tissue.
- Conducted heartbeat measurements on flies throughout various stages in their lifespan to analyze heart-function decline with age.
- Co-authorship in a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600623/) published in Aging, and semifinalist status in the 2015 Intel Science Talent Search (STS).

[**Rutgers Dept. of Physics**](https://physics.rutgers.edu/) | *Piscataway, NJ*
